## Requirements

* CakePHP 2.x

## Installation

### Git Clone


In your app directory:

    git clone git://github.com/boundaryfunctions/YoutubeHelper.git Plugin/Youtube

### Git Submodule

In your app directory:

    git submodule add git://github.com/boundaryfunctions/YoutubeHelper.git Plugin Youtube
    git update --init

### Without Git:

Download the [zipball](https://github.com/boundaryfunctions/YoutubeHelper/zipball/master "Download the repository zipped") and extract it to `app/Plugin/Youtube`.

## Usage

## Controller

Include the helper in your Controller:

    <?php
    class MyController extends AppController {
      public $helpers = array('Youtube.Youtube');
    }

You can also pass your own defaults for Iframe and Player to the helper like this:

    <?php
    class MyController extends AppController {
      public $helpers = array(
        'Youtube.Youtube' => array(
          'iframeOpts' => array(
            'width' => 640,
            'height' => 390,
            'frameborder' => 0
          ),
          'playerVars' = array(
            'autohide'    => 2,
            'autoplay'    => 0,
            'controls'    => 1,
            'enablejsapi' => 0,
            'loop'        => 0, 
            'origin'      => null,
            'rel'         => 0,
            'showinfo'    => 0,
            'start'       => null,
            'theme'       => 'dark'
          ),
        ),
      );
    }

Above you can see all default values. Additionally, you can specify additional options for `iframeopts` as you would pass it as the third argument `$options` to the (`HtmlHelper::tag()`)[http://api20.cakephp.org/class/html-helper#method-HtmlHelpertag] function.

You can also add more (query paramaters)[https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters#Parameters] to the `playerVars` array. If you want to remove a default parameter from the query, set it to `null`.

## View

After including the helper in your controller, you can use it like this in your views:

    $this->Youtube->iframe($url);

Where `$url` is a valid Youtube URL (i.e. `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zln9I9IttLA`) or ID (i.e. `Zln9I9IttLA`).

Additionaly, you can add custom options for the current Video only by passing an array of options for the Iframe as second argument and an array of parameters for the player as third argument:

    $this->Youtube->iframe($url, array('width' => 640), array('autohide' => 2));

## To do:

* Method to show Youtube Preview Images
* Method to include Iframes with (Youtube Javascript Iframe API)[https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference]
